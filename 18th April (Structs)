In Go, a struct is a composite data type that groups together zero or more fields of different types under a single name. It's similar to a class in object-oriented languages but lacks inheritance and methods. Here's a basic example of a struct definition in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a struct type named Person
type Person struct {
    name string
    age  int
}

func main() {
    // Create a new Person struct instance
    p := Person{name: "Alice", age: 30}

    // Accessing struct fields
    fmt.Println("Name:", p.name)
    fmt.Println("Age:", p.age)

    // Modifying struct fields
    p.age = 31
    fmt.Println("Updated Age:", p.age)
}
```

In this example:
- `Person` is defined as a struct type with two fields: `name` of type `string` and `age` of type `int`.
- An instance `p` of type `Person` is created with field values `"Alice"` and `30`.
- We access and modify the struct fields using dot notation (`p.name`, `p.age`).

Structs are commonly used in Go for modeling data structures, representing objects, and organizing related data. They are often passed by value, meaning when you pass a struct to a function or assign it to another variable, a copy of the struct is made. However, you can use pointers to structs to achieve pass-by-reference behavior.


## Empty structs and Mon empty structs in go
In Go, both empty structs and non-empty structs are used for different purposes.

1. **Non-empty structs**: These are structs that contain one or more fields. They are used to define composite data types that hold multiple values of different types. Non-empty structs are commonly used to represent objects or data structures.

   ```go
   type Person struct {
       Name string
       Age  int
   }
   ```

   In this example, `Person` is a non-empty struct with two fields: `Name` of type `string` and `Age` of type `int`.

2. **Empty structs**: An empty struct has no fields defined within it. It's denoted by just a pair of curly braces `{}`. Despite not containing any fields, empty structs are still useful in Go because they occupy zero bytes of memory. They are often used as a placeholder or a signal in certain situations, such as signaling events or as a marker in maps.

   ```go
   type Signal struct{}
   ```

   Here, `Signal` is an empty struct with no fields. It can be used as a signal type, for example, in a channel to signal an event:

   ```go
   ch := make(chan Signal)
   ```

   Sending a value through this channel doesn't carry any data but signals that an event has occurred.

Empty structs are also used in unique situations like creating set data structures or as a placeholder in certain patterns where only the presence or absence of a key in a map is important.
